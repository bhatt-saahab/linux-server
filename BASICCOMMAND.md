Your sir told you to **make SSH connection first** because:

### **Why first SSH? (Simple reason)**

- You need to **connect to the remote machine** before you can do anything on it.
- Without SSH, you **can‚Äôt access** or control that server.
- It‚Äôs like **opening the door** before entering a room.

### **In short:**

> SSH is the first step to control or work on another system remotely.
> 

Once connected via SSH, you can:

- Run commands
- Upload/download files
- Configure servers

**Command:**

```bash
ssh username@IP_address

```

# **üéØ Getting Help With Commands in Linux**

> Displays help documentation about usage, options, and syntax for each command.
> 

---

## **1. Terminal Help Flags**

Most Linux commands support `--help` or `-h` for a quick summary of usage.

### **Examples:**

- **List directory options**
    
    ```bash
    ls --help
    
    ```
    
- **Incorrect but common misunderstanding**
    
    ```bash
    ls -h
    
    ```
    
    *(This shows human-readable sizes, not help)*
    
- **Help for `sudo`**
    
    ```bash
    sudo --help
    
    ```
    
- **Help for `vim`**
    
    ```bash
    vim -h
    
    ```
    
- **Help for `crunch`**
    
    ```bash
    crunch --help
    
    ```
    
- **Help for `ts` (from moreutils)**
    
    ```bash
    ts --help
    
    ```
    

---

## **2. Using `man` ‚Äì The Manual Pages**

Use the `man` command to access **full documentation** for Linux commands.

### **Examples:**

```bash
man ls
man sudo
man vim
man crunch

```

> Tips:
> 
> - Press `q` to quit the manual.
> - Use arrow keys or `Space` to scroll.

---

## **3. Using `help` ‚Äì For Shell Built-in Commands**

Some commands like `cd`, `echo`, and `exit` are **built into the shell**, not standalone programs.

To get help on them, use:

```bash
help

```

Or to get help for a specific command:

```bash
help cd
help exit
help echo

```

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Summary

| **Purpose** | **Command** |
| --- | --- |
| Quick command help | `--help` / `-h` |
| Full manual page | `man <command>` |
| Help for shell built-ins | `help` |

# üìö **Manual and Info Pages in Linux**

---

### 1. Display the manual page for `crunch`

```bash
man crunch

```

---

### 2. Show the info page for `crunch` (often more detailed)

```bash
info crunch

```

---

### 3. Open the main manual interface

```bash
man

```

---

### 4. Search manual pages for any command related to `mkdir`

```bash
man -k mkdir

```

---

### 5. Search **exactly** for `mkdir`

```bash
man kmkdir$""

```

*(Note: This seems like a typo or unusual command ‚Äî typically, use quotes for exact match like:)*

```bash
man -k '^mkdir$'

```

---

### 6. Open the **section 2** manual for the `mkdir` system call

```bash
man 2 mkdir

```

---

### 7. Search and display information related to `passwd` and `ls` commands

```bash
man -k passwd
man 2 ls
info ls

```

*(Your original had `man-k p`*
