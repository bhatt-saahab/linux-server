**➤** Designed as a **portable**, **multi-user**, **multi-tasking** operating system.

**➤** Originally **proprietary**, it inspired many commercial and academic variants.

### **Major Variants:**

- **BSD** – Berkeley Software Distribution
- **AIX** – IBM
- **HP-UX** – Hewlett-Packard
- **Solaris** – Sun Microsystems

**➤** Dominated **academic**, **enterprise**, and **research** environments historically.

## **Linux**

**➤** Created by **Linus Torvalds** in **1991**

**➤** Inspired by Unix, but built from scratch

**➤** Released under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**

**➤** Often bundled with **GNU utilities** → called **GNU/Linux**

### **Popular Linux Distributions:**

# **What is an Operating System?**

**An OS is system software that:**

**➤** Manages hardware and software resources

**➤** Provides essential services to programs

---

## **Basic Flow of Operation:**

**1. Simple Model:**

**User Application** → **Hardware**

**2. With Shell & Kernel:**

**User** → **Shell** → **Kernel** → **Hardware**

| Real-Life Role | Shell | Kernel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🧑 User Interface | Like a **waiter** in a restaurant (takes your order) | Like a **chef** (prepares your order using resources) |
